 * My life is marked by a fascinating duality: the vastness of nature and the precision of technology. 
 * I am passionate about exploring new places, connecting with biodiversity, and at the same time, building 
 * applications that can improve people's lives and preserve our planet. My particular interest lies 
 * in application infrastructure, as it is the solid foundation on which meaningful 
 * digital experiences are built.
